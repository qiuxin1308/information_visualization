        <h3>Overview and Motivation</h3>
        <p>Wine has, more than any other drink, the ability to imbue its consumer with pleasure by the senses of sight, smell, taste and touch like no other drink. Wine is always attractive and popular to most people. However, how to choose a wine suitable and taste good is always a big challenge to people, especially to beginners. What we want to do is help user to know about the basic information about wine such as which wine is evaluated the best and which region or which brand produces the best wine.</p>

                After cleaning the dataset1, we keep 99882 wine information. We do some aggregate work and group them by country. Finally,we found that all these wine information are from 7 countries.

                    According to the data, we decide to pay the most attentin to the wine of USA since there are half data is from USA. We then group the wine in one country by state/province and get the statistic data of wine in each state. We plan to add more aggregate data such as mean score/ mean price of wine in each state to fit our request. But now, we only need the number of wine in each state.<br>
                    From the second dataset, we get the trade data from countries and import and export data.
        </p>
        <p>
            For now we have following data files:

                    this kind of data is for map generation which</p>

                    <p>regions of each countries<br>
                    example:USA_region.tsv, CountryID_region.tsv<br>
                    These data is for us to do the analysis for each country, we want to analyze and rank the wine of each state in specific country. For now, it only contains the number of wine in each state/province. We plan to do more aggregate calculation to get more data such as the mean point, mean price of wine to fit our request.But now, we only need number of wine to do visualization.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>wine information in each country<br>
                    example:CountryID.json<br>
                    These file contains the detail information to each wine in the specific country. We keep all the information we need for the analysis to these wine</p>

            <li>User can see all the graph in one screen without scrolling down.<br>
                we change our design multiple times to make sure that our user will not ignore all the graphs.<br>
                To ensure that, we make all the graph in one 100% screen, and add a lot of tip to guide user to use our website.
            </li>
            <li>All the graph in one section has interaction.<br>
                In each section, We make sure that all the praphs has strong interaction so that user can see the update of these graphs if they click the button or the bar.

            When a user moves the mouse over a country, a tooltip will display the country name and the total wine types in this country.<br>

            From the world map and the pie chart, users can easily understand which country produces the largest amount of wine, so we want to present whether these countries also has largest export of wine or import of wine. This chart can make users know how much a country earn profits from the export of wine and how much a country spends on the import of wine.<br>

This chart will tell users about the increment and decrement of wine trade between these countries. And when you click the bars, it will show a pie chart about where the wine (in billions) goes to or comes from. Following is the image to show an example about the bar chart.<br>
